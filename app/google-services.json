## Firebase Setup (Critical Steps)

To run this project, you **must** connect it to your own Firebase backend. Follow these steps carefully.

### 1. Create a Firebase Project

*   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
*   Click **"Add project"** and follow the on-screen instructions to create a new project.

### 2. Add an Android App to Your Project

*   Inside your new Firebase project, click the Android icon ( `</>` ) to add an Android app.
*   **Android package name**: This is the most important step. The package name you enter here **must** match the `applicationId` in the `app/build.gradle.kts` file. For this project, use:
    *   `com.example.bookcare`
*   **App nickname** (Optional): Give your app a memorable name (e.g., "Community Forum App").
*   **Debug signing certificate SHA-1** (Optional): You can skip this for now.
*   Click **"Register app"**.

### 3. Download and Place the `google-services.json` File
